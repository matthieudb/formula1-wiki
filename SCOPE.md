# Scope

We are making a Formula-1 data visualiser for the current 2025 season. There is an API that you can use (openf1.org). 


Look at context7 MCP server to find more context about the openF1 documentation and use that to find relevant information about the API.

This is a frontend project using React and Tailwind CSS. For stats you can use recharts, a complete library with components.

The layout has a navbar with the title Formula-1 wiki.

This features needs to be included:

- Dashboard with a few statistics (some stats cards with how many races we had this season, then under that a table where you can switch between driver/constructor standings)
- Driver information when clicking on a driver in the table where you can find some general information about the driver, and a performance analysis of the driver.
- Also show a table to the dashboard with all the circuits and when clicking on one you have circuit information.

The layout should be dark themed with a very modern look. It needs to have that modern touch to it.
