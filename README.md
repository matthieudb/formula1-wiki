# Fundamentals principles

- Write clean simple, readable code
- Implement feature in the simplest possible way
- Keep files small and focused (<200 lines)
- Test after every meaningful change
- Focus and core functionality before optimization
- Use clear, consistent naming
- Think thoroughly before coding, Write 2-3 reasoning paragraphs
- ALWAYS write simple, clean and modular code
- Use clear and easy-to-understand language, write in short sentences

# Error fixing

- DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. Consider multiple possible causes before deciding
- Explain the problem in plain English
- Make minimal necessary changes, changing a few lines of code as possible
- In case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a Perplexity web search to the latest up-to-date information.

# Building Process

- Verify each new feature works by telling the user how to test it.
- DO NOT write complicated and confusing code. Opt for the simple & modular approach
- When not sure what to do, tell the user to perform a web search

# Comments

- ALWAYS try to add more helpful and explanatory comments into our codebase
- NEVER delete old comments - unless they are obviously wrong / Obsolete
- Include LOTS of explanatory comments in your code. ALWAYS write well documented code.
- Document all changes and their reasoning IN THE COMMENTS YOU WRITING
- When writing comments, use clear and easy-to-understand language, with sort sentences.
